# Comparing data in MDN data and Webref

The [MDN data](https://github.com/mdn/data) repository advertizes that it is to be deprecated in favor of [Webref](https://github.com/w3c/webref).

This repository contains:

- The [`main.mjs`](main.mjs) Node.js script, which re-creates the MDN data structure from Webref data, and compares resulting data with a view to informing the related [Webref issue](https://github.com/w3c/webref/issues/1519).
- The [`webref.json`](webref.json) file, which contains the resulting data. The file is generated by the script.
- The [`report.md`](report.md) file, which contains a human-readable report of missing CSS features in Webref compared to MDN data, and of missing CSS features in MDN data compared to Webref. The file is also generated by the script.

To run the script locally and update the files:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run script with `node main.mjs`

**Note:** The objective is to inform further development in Webref. The repository will not be kept up-to-date.
