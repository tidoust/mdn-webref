# Comparing data in MDN data and Webref

The [MDN data](https://github.com/mdn/data) repository advertizes that it may be deprecated in favor of [Webref](https://github.com/w3c/webref). Webref updates may need to be considered for that to be doable and easy for consumers, as discussed in a related [Webref issue](https://github.com/w3c/webref/issues/1519).

This repository contains:

- The [`main.mjs`](main.mjs) Node.js script, which re-creates the MDN data structure from Webref data, and compares resulting data.
- The [`webref.json`](webref.json) file, which contains the resulting data.
- The [`report.md`](report.md) file, which contains a human-readable report of missing CSS features in Webref compared to MDN data, and of missing CSS features in MDN data compared to Webref.
- The [`report-syntax.md`](report-syntax.md) file, which contains a human-readable report of syntax mismatches between Webref and MDN data for data that they have in common.
- The [`report-nosyntax.md`](report-syntax.md) file, which contains a human-readable report of CSS features in Webref that do not have any known syntax.

JSON and markdown report files are generated by the script.

To run the script locally and update the files:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run script with `node main.mjs`

**Note:** The objective is to inform further development in Webref. The repository will not be kept up-to-date.
